1. Calibration Constant and Calibration Multiplier
    1. During factory calibration, sensor output (in microamps) is measured while the sensor is exposed to a standard lamp of known intensity.   The sensor output at this intensity has general units of microamps per radiation unit and is called the **Calibration Constant (Calconstant)**.  Each sensor has a slightly different output at a given radiation intensity and will therefore have a unique Calconstant (found in [System Information](#System_Information.md)).
    1. LI-COR Light Meters and dataloggers measure the current output of the sensor in units of microamps, and convert the measured current to units of radiation.  To make this conversion, LI-COR instruments use the sensor **Calibration Multiplier**, which is the negative reciprocal of the Calconstant (also found in [System Information](#System_Information.md)).
    1. The in-water multiplier includes an immersion effect correction on the calibration certificate.
    
    
3.2 Opening and Closing the miniPAR Logger
The miniPAR Loggerâ€™s circuitry is contained in a waterproof housing that must be opened.
Unscrewing the white pressure housing from the black end cap opens the miniPAR Logger.
This is similar to opening a flashlight. Turn the white pressure housing counter clockwise
relative to the black end cap. Close the miniPAR Logger by reversing this procedure after
being sure that the o-ring is free from debris. Lubricate the o-ring occasionally with silicone
oil intended for buna-N o-ring material.
When closing the miniPAR Logger, inspect the o-ring and the interior of the white pressure
housing for debris. Lubricate the o-ring, and screw the white pressure housing onto the black
end cap until the white pressure housing just touches the black end cap. Do not tighten! The
miniPAR Logger tends to get a little tighter during deployment.
If you cannot open the miniPAR Logger by yourself, then find another person with strong
hands. This person should grip the black end cap while the other person turns the white
pressure housing

1. Keeping the sensor clean to maintain accuracy of readings
    1. To maintain appropriate cosine correction the vertical edge of the diffuser must be kept clean. Periodically inspect the sensor for foreign deposits on the upper surfaces during prolonged submerged operation.
    1. DO NOT use alcohol, organic solvents, abrasives, or strong detergents to clean the diffusor element on LI-COR light sensors.
    1. The acrylic material used in LI-COR light sensors can be crazed by exposure to alcohol or organic solvents, which will adversely affect the cosine response of the sensor.
    1. Clean the sensor **only with water** (deionized "DI" water) and/or a mild detergent such as dishwashing soap. LI-COR has found that vinegar can also be used to remove hard water deposits from the diffusor element, if necessary.
    1. Keep the sensors clean and treat them as a scientific instrument in order to maintain the accuracy of the calibration. The vertical edge of the LI-192 diffuser must be kept clean in order to maintain appropriate cosine correction.
